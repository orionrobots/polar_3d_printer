# Polar 3D Printer exploration

A test project - exploring using polar coordinates to drive a 3D printer with 2 polar steppers.
I know it's probably been done - but wanted to explore how, and figure out what coverage I had myself over the area.

Not a complete project.
No guarantees that any of this still works - but use it as you wish.
Credit me @orionrobots if it was helpful.
