Standard stepper is often 1.8 degrees.

What is the best resolution I can expect?

the lego nxt motor is 360 ticks per turn.. Lets feed in 1 degree and see what it looks like

The rep-rap stepper page talks of half steps and quarter steps - so we may be able to do this.

If I want a print bed of 150mm by 150mm, with a resolution of 0.1mm
 Then this is 1500 by 1500. How bad does the plot look at that res?

Plan must be:
The output stage:
    - convert an angle into a number of steps based on stepper characteristics.
    - go through another stage that plots them on screen transforming steps into on screen movements.
    - Takes the stream of middle stage instructions, along with annotations (tool down, tool up).
The input stage - for now, just call to a line function - x,y, x2, y2, and moveto x,y function.
The middle stage - take the line, return a stream of coordinates for the plotting points here.

The basics of the middle stage works. The input stage can be a test env. So build the output stages.

Build a KineToSteppers class.
Build a SteppersToScreen class (the pygame output/render stage)

KineToSteppers takes:
  - Machine output class
  - Input stream
    a1, a2, tool_params
  - Machine output will get stream of:
    * stepper1 en, dir, stepper 2 en, dir,tool params
    * machine output will block until machine has reached the position needed.

ok - expect a homing pin/switch under the position we call 0,0 - where the disk is directly centered under the
